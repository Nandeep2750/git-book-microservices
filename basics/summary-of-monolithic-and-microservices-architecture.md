# Summary of Monolithic & Microservices architecture

## Monolithic:

* Traditional software architecture approach
* Single application with tightly coupled components
* Changes require redeploying the entire application
* Scaling involves scaling the entire application
* Shared libraries and dependencies can cause challenges
* Limited flexibility to use different frameworks and languages
* Maintenance and deployment become complex as the application grows

### Challenges/Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture:

* Complexity and difficulty in understanding the entire system
* Tight coupling between components leading to potential unintended effects
* Limited flexibility in using different frameworks and languages
* Inefficient scalability, requiring scaling of the entire application
* Complex deployment process and potential downtime during updates
* Higher risk of failure due to the interconnected nature of the application
* Slower iteration and delivery of updates
* Lack of agility in making changes without redeploying the entire application.

## Microservices:

* Modular and decentralised architecture
* Each application function is a separate service
* Services are deployed in containers and communicate via APIs
* Easy to develop, deploy, and manage initially
* Independent scaling of services based on demand
* Flexibility to use different languages and frameworks for each service
* Continuous deployment and faster iteration of services
* Reduced risk of application failure due to isolated services

### Benefits of Microservices:

* Language and framework independence
* Faster iteration and deployment
* Reduced risk and smaller change impact
* Ability to add new components easily
* Independent scalability based on demand
