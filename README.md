# Introduction to Microservices

## **What are Microservices?**

> Microservices are a software architecture approach where an **application is divided into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on performing a specific task and can communicate with other services** through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

To understand microservices, **imagine a large application as a collection of individual building blocks, where each block represents a service.** Each service is responsible for handling a specific functionality or feature of the application, such as user authentication, payment processing, or product recommendations.

**These services operate independently and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately from one another.** They communicate with each other using standardised protocols, such as HTTP or message queues, allowing them to work together to provide the overall application's functionality.

This modular and decentralised architecture offers several benefits. It enables teams to develop and maintain services independently, making it easier to understand, test, and update specific parts of the application. It also allows for better scalability, as each service can be scaled individually based on its specific needs.

**In summary**, microservices **provide a way to build complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, self-contained services** that work together to deliver the desired functionality.
