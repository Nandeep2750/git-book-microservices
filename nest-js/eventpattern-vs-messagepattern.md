# EventPattern vs MessagePattern

In Nest.js, `@MessagePattern` and `@EventPattern` are decorators used for different purposes, and they are associated with different communication patterns when working with microservices.

1.  **@MessagePattern**:

    * `@MessagePattern` is used for request-response communication patterns between microservices.
    * It is suitable for scenarios where a service sends a request to another service and expects a response.
    * The `@MessagePattern` decorator is typically used with the `client.send` method in Nest.js to send a request and await a response from another service.
    * It is useful when you need synchronous communication between services, such as making a request to fetch data or performing an action that requires a response.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    // In a service
    @MessagePattern('user.get')
    getUser(data: any): Promise<User> {
      // Fetch and return user data
    }
    ```
2.  **@EventPattern**:

    * `@EventPattern` is used for the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) communication pattern between microservices.
    * It is suitable for scenarios where a service publishes events (messages) to a message broker, and other services subscribe to those events to react asynchronously.
    * It is commonly used for broadcasting events like "UserRegistered," "OrderPlaced," or "DataUpdated" to multiple services.
    * The `@EventPattern` decorator is not used for request-response communication; it's about broadcasting events to other services and reacting to those events.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    // In a service
    @EventPattern('user.registered')
    handleUserRegistered(data: any): void {
      // Handle the UserRegistered event
    }
    ```

To sum it up:

* If you need synchronous request-response communication between services, use `@MessagePattern`.
* If you want to implement asynchronous event-driven communication, use `@EventPattern` to handle events published by other services.

For scenarios where you need to handle events asynchronously and broadcast them to multiple services, **`@EventPattern`** is the more appropriate choice. Let's take an example handling the "UserRegistered" event, **`@EventPattern`** is the correct decorator because you are broadcasting an event, not making a request for a response.\
